# 🗓️ Day 1: Git + GitHub Setup

## What I Did
- Installed Git
- Set up my GitHub account
- Created my first local Git repo using `git init`
- Made my first commit!
- Linked to GitHub and pushed my code online

## What I Learned
- Git tracks your code changes (version control)
- GitHub stores your code online (and shows it off)
- `git add .` stages all changes
- `git commit -m` saves them with a message
- `git push` sends them to GitHub

Cheat Sheet:
Concept	                        What It Does ?
git init	                    Starts Git in your folder
git add	                        Stages files for saving
git commit	                    Saves a snapshot
git push	                    Sends code to GitHub
git remote	                    Links local repo to GitHub
git status	                    What changed since last save?
git add FILENAME	            Stage specific file
git add .	                    Stage everything
git commit -m "Your message"	Save a snapshot locally
git push	                    Upload changes to GitHub

## Questions I Still Have
- What’s the difference between `git add` and `git commit` exactly?
- What are branches and pull requests?
