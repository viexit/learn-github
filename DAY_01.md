# 🗓️ Day 1: Git + GitHub Setup

## ✅ What I Did
- Installed Git
- Set up my GitHub account
- Created my first local Git repo using `git init`
- Made my first commit!
- Linked to GitHub and pushed my code online

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Git tracks your code changes (version control)
- GitHub stores your code online (and shows it off)
- `git add .` stages all changes
- `git commit -m` saves them with a message
- `git push` sends them to GitHub

## 🧩 Questions I Still Have
- What’s the difference between `git add` and `git commit` exactly?
- What are branches and pull requests?
